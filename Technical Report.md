# Technical Report - Predicting NHL Playoff Success
## Problem Statement
The National Hockey League (NHL) has a reputation for being unpredictable. While there are many franchises that have enjoyed years of continued success and playoff berths, nothing is taken for granted in the playoffs. It is not uncommon for low seeded teams to win playoff series in the NHL. The 2012 Los Angeles Kings even won the Stanley Cup as an 8 seed. As a strict salary cap league, the NHL enjoys a level of parity that makes for an exceedingly exciting postseason.

With all that being said, my goal here is to see if it is possible to create a classification model that can predict playoff outcomes using regular season data from that year. The purpose for this model is twofold. First, with sports gambling becoming legalized and the increasing popularity of fantasy sports, an accurate predictive model would be very valuable to many people.

Second, I made it a point to keep the results of this model interpretable. I was interested to see which factors and statistics from the regular season are predictive of playoff success. If the model has a high degree of accuracy or predictive power, the results of those predictive factors and statistics would be valuable to NHL franchises in helping to build a "team profile for success."  

## Gathering data
